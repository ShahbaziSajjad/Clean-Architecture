## Introduction

Briefly introduce your project and its goals.

## MVI Architecture

### Overview

Model-View-Intent (MVI) is an architectural pattern that separates concerns in Android app development. It emphasizes a unidirectional data flow and immutable states.

### Key Concepts

- **Model**: Represents the current state of the application.
- **View**: Renders the UI based on the model's state.
- **Intent**: Represents user actions or events that trigger state changes.

### Detailed Explanation

Provide a detailed explanation of how MVI is implemented in your project. Discuss the benefits and rationale behind choosing this architecture.

## Clean Architecture

### Overview

Clean Architecture is a design philosophy that separates concerns into distinct layers, making the codebase scalable, maintainable, and testable.

### Key Concepts

- **Entities**: Contain enterprise-wide business rules.
- **Use Cases**: Contain application-specific business rules.
- **Interface Adapters**: Convert data between the use cases and entities.
- **Frameworks & Drivers**: Implement external frameworks and tools.

### Detailed Explanation

Explain how Clean Architecture is integrated into your project, and discuss the advantages it provides in terms of scalability and maintainability.

## Coroutine

### Overview

Coroutines are a lightweight concurrency design pattern in Kotlin for managing asynchronous tasks.

### Key Concepts

- **Coroutine Scope**: Defines the lifespan of a coroutine.
- **Suspending Functions**: Functions that can be paused and resumed.
- **Dispatchers**: Define the thread or threads a coroutine runs on.

### Detailed Explanation

Discuss how coroutines are used in your project for asynchronous operations, and highlight any specific use cases.

## Jetpack Compose

### Overview

Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit for building native Android applications.

### Key Concepts

- **Declarative UI**: Define the UI based on the current state of the application.
- **Compose Functions**: Build UI components using Kotlin functions.
- **State Management**: Manage UI state efficiently.

### Detailed Explanation

Explain how Jetpack Compose is leveraged to build the UI in your project. Provide examples of declarative UI and state management.

## Koin

### Overview

Koin is a lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin.

### Key Concepts

- **Modules**: Define how dependencies are provided.
- **Scopes**: Manage the lifespan of dependencies.

### Detailed Explanation

Describe how Koin is used for dependency injection in your project and how it simplifies the management of dependencies.

## Getting Started
