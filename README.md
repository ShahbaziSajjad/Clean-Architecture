    <h2>Clean Architecture</h2>

    <p>Clean Architecture, introduced by Robert C. Martin, is a software design philosophy revolutionizing Android development. It advocates for a clear separation of concerns through distinct layers, enabling scalable and maintainable applications. Key components include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Entities:</strong> Central business objects or data structures.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Cases (Interactors):</strong> Implementation of application-specific business rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Repositories:</strong> Bridging layer between use cases and external data sources, such as databases or APIs.</li>
      <li><strong>Frameworks and Drivers:</strong> External tools and delivery mechanisms like UI components and database interfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Implementation Strategies</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Clear Layer Boundaries:</strong> Maintain strict dependencies between layers, ensuring each layer depends only on those beneath it.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):</strong> Implement dependency injection to invert dependencies, enhancing flexibility and testability.</li>
      <li><strong>Testability:</strong> Empower independent testing of business rules within the use case layer, leveraging mock dependencies for comprehensive coverage.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Model-View-Intent (MVI)</h2>

    <p>MVI represents a paradigm shift in Android architecture, emphasizing unidirectional data flow. It consists of key components facilitating a predictable and scalable approach to UI development:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Model (State):</strong> Represents the current state of the application.</li>
      <li><strong>View:</strong> Responsible for rendering the UI based on the current state.</li>
      <li><strong>Intent:</strong> Represents user actions or events, triggering state changes.</li>
      <li><strong>ViewModel (Presenter):</strong> Manages business logic and interactions between the Model and View.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Implementation Best Practices</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Unidirectional Data Flow:</strong> Establish a clear and consistent flow from Intent to ViewModel to Model to View for improved maintainability.</li>
      <li><strong>Immutable State:</strong> Utilize immutable data structures, such as Kotlin data classes, to effectively manage and represent application state.</li>
      <li><strong>Reactive Programming:</strong> Leverage reactive programming libraries, including RxJava, Kotlin Flow, or LiveData, for handling asynchronous operations.</li>
      <li><strong>Advanced Testing Strategies:</strong> Implement comprehensive testing methodologies for each component, ensuring the correctness and reliability of the entire flow.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistent UI Updates:</strong> Guarantee that UI updates consistently align with the current application state, creating a seamless user experience.</li>
    </ol>
